# Master Review: Seeds — Structure and Germination (Sections 6.1 to 6.6)

*(Narrator’s voice, reflective and steady, like a teacher drawing the last diagram of the lesson on the board)*

## 1. What is a Seed? (6.1)
- **Fruit** = ripened ovary, fruit wall enclosing the seed (mango, pea pod).  
- **Seed** = ripened ovule, contains embryo + seed coat (bean, pea).  
- **Grain** = fruit wall fused with seed coat (maize, wheat).  
- Dormancy: embryo inactive but alive, waiting for the right conditions.  

**Terms to fix in mind:** fruit, ovary, ovule, seed coat, embryo, dormancy, grain.

## 2. Classification and Structure of Seeds (6.2)
- **Monocotyledonous**: one cotyledon (maize, grasses).  
- **Dicotyledonous**: two cotyledons (pea, bean, gram).  
- Seeds vary in size: dust-like orchids → giant double coconut.  
- Based on endosperm:  
  - **Albuminous**: endosperm persists, cotyledons thin (poppy, cereals).  
  - **Exalbuminous**: endosperm used up, cotyledons thick (pea, mango).  

**Technical parts in dicot (bean):** testa, tegmen, hilum (scar), micropyle (pore), cotyledons (food), embryo (radicle = root, plumule = shoot).  
**Technical parts in monocot (maize):** scutellum (cotyledon), coleorhiza (root sheath), coleoptile (shoot sheath), endosperm, aleurone layer.  

**Terms to fix:** cotyledon, albuminous, exalbuminous, testa, tegmen, hilum, micropyle, radicle, plumule, scutellum, coleoptile, coleorhiza, aleurone.

## 3. Germination (6.3)
- **Definition**: process of seedling formation from the embryo.  
- Dormant embryo awakens when water, oxygen, and warmth are present.  
- Fresh seeds may not sprout immediately → need dormancy period for physiological maturation.  
- **Conditions required:**  
  1. **Water** → swelling, rupturing coat, enzyme activity.  
  2. **Temperature** → optimum 25–35°C (too low = inhibits, too high = kills).  
  3. **Oxygen** → needed for respiration and energy.  
- Seeds sown too deep often fail: no oxygen, no pushing force.  

**Terms to fix:** germination, dormancy, optimum temperature, respiration, enzyme action.

## 4. Experiments on Germination (6.4)
- **Water required:** seeds on wet vs dry cotton (only wet germinates).  
- **Temperature required:** seeds at room vs refrigerator (only room germinates).  
- **Oxygen required:** flask with oxygen removed vs flask with air (only with air germinates).  
- **Three-bean experiment:**  
  - Top seed → only oxygen, no water (no germination).  
  - Middle seed → water + oxygen (germinates).  
  - Bottom seed → water but little oxygen (fails after tiny sprout).  

**Exam anchor:** three conditions (water, temp, oxygen) proven experimentally.

## 5. Types of Germination (6.5)
- **Epicotyl** = region above cotyledons. **Hypocotyl** = region below cotyledons.  
- **Hypogeal germination**: epicotyl elongates, cotyledons stay underground (pea, maize, gram).  
- **Epigeal germination**: hypocotyl elongates, cotyledons lifted above ground (bean, castor).  
- Trade-off logic:  
  - Hypogeal = protection, suited for deeper/heavier soils.  
  - Epigeal = faster growth, cotyledons may photosynthesise, but exposed to danger.  

**Terms to fix:** epicotyl, hypocotyl, hypogeal, epigeal.  

---

## 6. Germination in Some Common Seeds (6.6)
- **Pea (Hypogeal)**: testa bursts, radicle root system, plumule arched upward, cotyledons underground.  
- **Maize (Hypogeal)**: radicle emerges through coleorhiza (dies off, replaced by new roots), plumule emerges through coleoptile, scutellum absorbs food from endosperm, cotyledon stays underground.  
- **Bean (Epigeal)**: hypocotyl arch lifts cotyledons above ground, they may turn green and photosynthesise briefly.  
- **Vivipary (special in mangroves)**: seed germinates inside fruit while still attached to parent; seedling drops into soil and anchors (e.g., *Rhizophora*).  
- **The Seedling**: final stage; roots absorb minerals, leaves photosynthesise, seedling becomes independent.  

**Terms to fix:** vivipary, coleorhiza, coleoptile, scutellum, seedling.

## The Big Picture (Exam-Ready Mental Map)
1. **Seed basics** (fruit vs seed vs grain; structure).  
2. **Classification** (monocot vs dicot; albuminous vs exalbuminous).  
3. **Parts of seed** (bean vs maize; dicot vs monocot).  
4. **Dormancy & Germination** (conditions: water, oxygen, temperature).  
5. **Experiments** proving conditions.  
6. **Types of germination** (hypogeal vs epigeal → logic & trade-offs).  
7. **Examples** (pea, maize, bean, mangrove vivipary).  
8. **Seedling** (independence, photosynthesis, growth).  

*(Narrator’s closing reflection)*  
“Think of a seed not as a dry fact, but as a living story: food store, protective coats, a sleeping embryo, and strategies for waking into the world. From bean to maize, pea to mangrove, each plant answers life’s challenge differently — but the lesson is one: patience, adaptation, and survival.”
