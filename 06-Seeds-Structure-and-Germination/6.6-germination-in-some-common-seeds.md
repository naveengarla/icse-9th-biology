### Vivipary — Germination While Still Attached  
*(Narrator’s voice, calm and awe-struck, as the camera pans over mangrove swamps)*  

“Most seeds wait. They fall to the ground, rest in dormancy, and only later begin to grow. But in mangroves — in plants like *Rhizophora* and *Sonneratia* — nature bends the rule.  

Here, the seed germinates **while still inside the fruit, attached to the parent plant**. The young root pierces out first, and when mature, the entire seedling drops into the mud below, where it anchors itself.  

This is called **vivipary** — literally meaning ‘producing live young ones.’ It is the plant world’s version of giving birth to already-sprouted offspring, an adaptation to waterlogged soils where ordinary seeds would rot before sprouting.”

### The Seedling  
*(Narrator’s voice, warm and reassuring, like watching a young plant grow in time-lapse)*  

“Every germination story ends in the same way — with the birth of a **seedling**.  

At first, the seedling still depends on stored food in the cotyledons or endosperm. But soon, roots grow deep to absorb water and minerals. The plumule unfolds into leaves, and photosynthesis begins.  

At that moment, the seedling becomes independent. It can make its own food, grow taller, and eventually become a mature plant — ready in its turn to flower, fruit, and produce new seeds.”
