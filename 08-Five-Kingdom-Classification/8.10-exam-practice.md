</details>

---

### Q23. Twist: Which of these crosses is a plant, not an animal: Mule, Pomato, Zenkey, Tigon?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Pomato


</details>

---

### Q24. Logical: Why does nature produce hybrids if they cannot survive as species?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** They show that species boundaries are not absolute walls, but fertility ensures that each species maintains its identity.


</details>

---

### Q25. Challenge: Write one difference between 'variation within a species' and 'hybrid between species'.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Variation within a species still allows fertile offspring (e.g., human races, cat breeds). Hybrids between species produce sterile offspring (e.g., mule, tigon).


</details>

---

### Q26. Why do we need a scientific system of naming organisms?

<details>

**Answer:** Species, written with a small letter.


</details>

---

### Q31. Which language is used for scientific naming of organisms? Why?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Latin, because it is a dead language and does not change with time.


</details>

---

### Q32. How are scientific names written when typed and when handwritten?

<details>

**Answer:** Solanum tuberosum; Solanum melongena


</details>

---

### Q40. Why is it incorrect to write 'homo Sapiens'?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Because the genus must be capitalised (Homo) and the species must be lowercase (sapiens).


</details>

---

### Q41. Logical: Why does every organism need both genus and species name, not just one?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Genus groups related organisms; species specifies the exact organism. Without both, names could be ambiguous.


</details>

---

### Q42. Twist: If someone writes 'Homo Sapiens', how many mistakes are there?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>


**Answer:** Two mistakes: Species should be lowercase; both words should be italicised or underlined.
