### **2.8 STRUCTURE OF A CELL: Welcome to Cell City!**

We've talked about how cells were discovered, their rules, their size, and their shape. Now, it's time to take our super-powered microscope and zoom right inside one. What does a cell actually look like on the inside?

Even though a nerve cell looks very different from a muscle cell, they all share a **basic structural plan**. Think of it like cars. A sports car and a big truck look different, but they all have the same basic parts: a body, an engine, and a place for the driver.

A "generalised cell" is our model car. It has all the basic parts. We can say that every cell is like a tiny, bustling city, and every city has three essential parts:

1.  **The City Border (Cell Membrane):** A wall or gate that controls what comes in and what goes out.
2.  **The City Hall / Main Office (Nucleus):** The control centre that holds all the important information and gives all the orders.
3.  **The City Itself (Cytoplasm):** Everything inside the border, except the main office. This is where all the action happens—the factories, power plants, and roads are all here.

Let's put this into a simple diagram for our "Cell City":

[**Image/Diagram Placeholder:** A large circle representing the "Cell City". Inside, draw a smaller circle labeled "City Hall (Nucleus)". The space between the two circles is labeled "The City Itself (Cytoplasm)". The outer line of the large circle is labeled "City Border (Cell Membrane)".]

**Meet the Residents: Cell Organelles**

Now, a city isn't just empty space. It's filled with buildings and structures that do specific jobs: power plants make energy, factories build products, and garbage trucks clean up waste.

In a cell, these specialised structures are called **cell organelles**, which literally means "little organs." Just like your heart, lungs, and stomach are organs that keep your body running, these organelles are the tiny organs that keep the cell alive.

> **Exam Focus: What are Organelles?**
> **Organelles** are specialised structures within the cytoplasm of a cell that have a definite shape and perform a specific function. Importantly, **cell organelles are living parts** of the cell.

In the upcoming sections, we will explore each of these "little organs" one by one. We'll visit the power plants (Mitochondria), the factories (Ribosomes), the packaging department (Golgi bodies), and many more fascinating places within our Cell City.

Below are the blueprints for two major types of cities we'll be studying: an Animal Cell City and a Plant Cell City. You'll notice they share many of the same organelles, but also have some unique structures of their own!

[**Image/Diagram Placeholder:**
**A - Generalised Animal Cell:** A circular or irregular-shaped cell. Key labels to point out are the Cell Membrane (outer border), the central Nucleus (with a Nucleolus inside), the jelly-like Cytoplasm filling the cell, and various organelles floating in it like Mitochondria, Ribosomes, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Lysosomes.

**B - Generalised Plant Cell:** A more rectangular or boxy-shaped cell. It has everything the animal cell has, but with three key additions: a thick outer **Cell Wall** outside the cell membrane, large green **Chloroplasts**, and a very large central **Vacuole** (like a big water tank).]

**The 3 Essential Parts of a Generalised Cell**
1.  **Cell Membrane:** The outer boundary controlling entry and exit. (The City Border)
2.  **Nucleus:** The control centre containing the genetic material. (The City Hall)
3.  **Cytoplasm:** The jelly-like substance filling the cell, where organelles are located. (The City Grounds)

**Key Term & Definition**
*   **Cell Organelles:**
    *   **Meaning:** "Little organs".
    *   **Definition:** Living, specialised structures within a cell that perform specific functions.
    *   **Examples:** Nucleus, Mitochondria, Ribosomes, etc.

**Key Difference to Spot in Diagrams**
*   **Animal Cell:** Irregular shape, no cell wall.
*   **Plant Cell:** Fixed, rectangular shape due to a rigid **Cell Wall**. Often has large green **Chloroplasts** and a big **Vacuole**.
