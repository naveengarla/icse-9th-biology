# üìò Chapter 2: The Cell ‚Äì The Unit of Life  
**Detailed Quick Reference Notes (Exam Ready)**  

---

## 2.1 What is a Cell?
- Cell = structural and functional unit of life.  
- Discovered by **Robert Hooke (1665)** in cork slices using a simple microscope.  
- **Leeuwenhoek (1674):** First to see living cells (bacteria, protozoa).  
- Every living thing = made of cells.  

---

## 2.2 Invention of Microscope & Discovery of Cell
- Early microscopes by **Leeuwenhoek** revealed single-celled organisms.  
- Better microscopes ‚Üí details of nucleus, cytoplasm, organelles discovered.  
- Two important scientists:  
  - **Schleiden (1838):** All plants are made of cells.  
  - **Schwann (1839):** All animals are made of cells.  

---

## 2.3 Cell Theory
1. All living organisms are made of one or more cells.  
2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and function.  
3. All cells arise from **pre-existing cells** (added by Rudolf Virchow, 1858).  
- Basis of modern biology.  

---

## 2.4 Cells ‚Äì How Many?
- **Unicellular organisms:** Made of one cell (Amoeba, Paramecium, Chlamydomonas, Bacteria).  
- **Multicellular organisms:** Made of many cells (Humans, Trees, Animals).  
- Human body ‚Üí trillions of cells.  

---

## 2.5 Cells ‚Äì How Small?
- **Smallest cells:** Bacteria (0.3‚Äì5.0 Œºm).  
- **Human RBCs:** ~7 Œºm in diameter.  
- **Longest cells:** Nerve cells (up to 1 metre in humans, even longer in animals like whales).  
- **Largest cells:** Ostrich egg (a single cell, before development).  
- Importance ‚Üí size is related to function.  

---

## 2.6 Smallness of Cells = Greater Efficiency
- Small size = larger **surface area : volume ratio**.  
- Benefits:

  - Called **‚ÄúPowerhouse of the cell‚Äù**.  

- **Lysosomes (animals):**  
  - Membrane-bound sacs with digestive enzymes.  
  - Digest unwanted materials, worn-out organelles, or invaders.  
  - Called **‚ÄúSuicide bags‚Äù** (burst = digest own cell).  

- **Centrosome (animals):**  
  - Near nucleus; contains two **centrioles**.  
  - Organizes spindle fibres during cell division.  

- **Plastids (plants only):**  
  - Triple types:  
    - **Chloroplasts:** Green (chlorophyll), photosynthesis.  
    - **Chromoplasts:** Coloured (carotene, xanthophyll), give colour to fruits/flowers.  
    - **Leucoplasts:** Colourless, storage of starch, fats, proteins.  

- **Vacuoles:**  
  - Membrane-bound sacs.  
  - Large in plants (filled with cell sap).  
  - Store water, salts, waste, pigments.  
  - Small and temporary in animals.  

- **Granules (Inclusions):**  
  - Stored food (starch in plants, glycogen in animals, fat droplets).  
  - Non-living inclusions.  

---

### 2.8.3 Nucleus
- Surrounded by **double nuclear membrane** with pores.  
- Contains:  
  - **Nucleoplasm:** Fluid inside.  
  - **Nucleolus:** Makes ribosomes.  
  - **Chromatin:** DNA + proteins; condenses into chromosomes during division.  
- Functions:  
  - Controls all activities.  
  - Stores genetic information.  
  - Transmits hereditary traits.
