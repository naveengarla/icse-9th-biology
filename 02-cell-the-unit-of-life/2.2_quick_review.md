# üìò Chapter 2: The Cell ‚Äì The Unit of Life  
**Quick Reference Notes (Exam Ready)**  

---

## 2.1 What is a Cell?
- Basic unit of structure and function in all living organisms.  
- Discovered by Robert Hooke (1665) in cork.  

---

## 2.2 Invention of Microscope & Discovery of Cell
- Anton van Leeuwenhoek: First to observe living cells (1674).  
- Schleiden (plants) & Schwann (animals) ‚Üí Cell Theory.  

---

## 2.3 Cell Theory
1. All living things are made of cells.  
2. Cell is the basic unit of structure & function.  
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells.  

---

## 2.4 Cells ‚Äì How Many?
- Unicellular: Amoeba, Paramecium.  
- Multicellular: Humans, plants.  

---

## 2.5 Cells ‚Äì How Small?
- Bacteria: 0.3‚Äì5 Œºm (smallest).  
- RBC: ~7 Œºm.  
- Nerve cell: Longest.  
- Ostrich egg: Largest single cell.  

---

## 2.6 Smallness of Cells = Greater Efficiency
- Smaller size ‚Üí larger surface area to volume ratio ‚Üí faster exchange of materials.  

---

## 2.7 Cell Shapes
- RBC ‚Üí circular, biconcave.  
- Nerve cell ‚Üí long with projections.  
- Muscle cell ‚Üí elongated.  

---

## 2.8 Structure of a Cell
### 2.8.1 Boundaries
- **Cell Wall (plants only):** Rigid, made of cellulose.  
- **Cell Membrane:** Selectively permeable.  

### 2.8.2 Cytoplasm & Organelles
- **Cytoplasm:** Jelly medium; holds organelles.  
- **Ribosomes:** Protein factories.  
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:**  
  - Rough ER: With ribosomes, transports proteins.  
  - Smooth ER: No ribosomes, makes fats/detoxifies.  
- **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies, packages proteins.  
- **Mitochondria:** Powerhouse, makes ATP, has own DNA.  
- **Lysosomes (animals):** Digest waste.  
- **Centrosome (animals):** For cell division.  
- **Plastids (plants):**  
  - Chloroplasts: Photosynthesis.  
  - Chromoplasts: Colored pigments.  
  - Leucoplasts: Storage.  
- **Vacuoles:** Storage sacs (large in plants).  
- **Granules:** Stored starch/glycogen/fat.  

### 2.8.3 Nucleus
- Nuclear membrane with pores.  
- Nucleolus ‚Üí makes ribosomes.  
- Chromatin (DNA + proteins) ‚Üí chromosomes.  
- Controls all activities; stores genetic info.

## 2.9 Plant vs Animal Cells (Table)

| Feature | Plant Cell | Animal Cell |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Cell wall | Present | Absent |
| Centrosome | Absent | Present |
| Vacuoles | Large, permanent | Small, temporary |
| Plastids | Present | Absent |
| Shape | Fixed | Variable |

---

## 2.10 Protoplasm
- Living substance = Cytoplasm + Nucleus.  
- Contains water, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, salts.  

---

## 2.11 Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

| Feature | Prokaryotic | Eukaryotic |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | Primitive (nucleoid) | True nucleus |
| DNA | Naked, circular | Linear, with proteins |
| Organelles | Absent (except ribosomes) | Many (ER, Golgi, mitochondria, etc.) |
| Example | Bacteria, cyanobacteria | Plants, animals, fungi |

---

## 2.12 Cellular Activities
- Growth ‚Üí more cells.  
- Repair ‚Üí cell division.  
- Movement ‚Üí muscle cells.  
- Nutrition ‚Üí digestive enzymes, absorption.  
- Circulation ‚Üí heart cells pump blood.  
- Respiration ‚Üí mitochondria, blood cells.  
- Protection ‚Üí WBCs fight germs.  
- Senses ‚Üí sensory cells.  
- Reproduction ‚Üí sperm & egg.  
- In plants: absorption (roots), conduction (xylem, phloem), photosynthesis (chloroplasts).  

---

## üå± Extra Information
- **Stem cells:** Can multiply & differentiate.  
  - Embryonic stem cells: form any tissue.  
  - Tissue-specific stem cells: limited roles.  
  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS): reprogrammed normal cells.  

---

## üìå Points to Remember
- Cell is basic unit of life.  
- Cell theory = structure + function + origin.  
- Plant vs animal differences.  
- Protoplasm = living substance.  
- Prokaryote vs eukaryote.  
- All life activities = cellular activities.

## üìù Quick Mnemonics
- **Cell Organelles order (Protein journey):**  
  **N**aughty **R**ats **R**un **G**o **M**ad  
  ‚Üí Nucleus ‚Üí Ribosome ‚Üí Rough ER ‚Üí Golgi ‚Üí Membrane  

- **Plastids:**  
  - Chloroplast (green, photosynthesis)  
  - Chromoplast (colours)  
  - Leucoplast (storage)

## ‚ùì Review Q&A (for self-check)
1. Who discovered cells and when?  
   ‚Üí Robert Hooke, 1665.  
2. Why are cells so small?  
   ‚Üí Larger surface area to volume ratio, better efficiency.  
3. Difference between plant and animal cell (any 2 points).  
   ‚Üí Plant: cell wall, plastids, large vacuole. Animal: lysosomes, centrosome.  
4. What is protoplasm?  
   ‚Üí Cytoplasm + Nucleus (living part).  
5. Example of a prokaryote and a eukaryote.  
   ‚Üí Prokaryote: Bacteria. Eukaryote: Amoeba/Plants/Animals.
