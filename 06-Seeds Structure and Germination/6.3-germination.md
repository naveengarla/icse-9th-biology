## 6.3 Germination  
*(Narrator’s voice, calm and observant, opening on a still seed lying in the soil)*  

“Pick up a dry seed. To the eye it looks lifeless — hard, wrinkled, silent. But inside, the embryo waits. It is not dead. It is in **dormancy**, a period of rest. Life continues, but in whispers: tiny chemical activities, slow breathing of oxygen in, carbon dioxide out, and even a faint release of heat.”  

*(Narrator’s aside)*  
“This is the paradox of seeds: they appear inert, but carry the pulse of life slowed to the gentlest rhythm.”  

When conditions turn favourable, the dormant embryo **awakens**. The slow stirrings transform into growth. The tiny plant begins to emerge. This process, the unfolding of a new seedling from the embryo, is called **germination**.  

Germination is not instant. A freshly shed seed often refuses to sprout, even in ideal soil. It must pass through its **dormancy period**, a time of physiological maturation. Only then does it respond fully to water, warmth, and air.  

*(Narrator’s reflection)*  
“Dormancy, then, is not wasted time. It is nature’s way of ensuring that the seed does not awaken too soon, that it waits until the world is ready for its growth.”  

### Conditions Necessary for Germination  
*(Narrator’s voice, calm and instructive, with close-ups of seeds swelling in soil)*  

For germination, three conditions are essential: **water, suitable temperature, and oxygen.**

#### 1. Water  
Seeds absorb water mainly through the **micropyle**, the tiny gateway in the seed coat. Water has two crucial roles:  
1. It makes the seed swell, rupturing the coat so that the **radicle** can emerge to form the root system.  
2. It activates enzymes. These enzymes act on stored food in the cotyledons or endosperm, converting it into soluble forms the embryo can absorb.  

*(Narrator’s imagery)*  
“Water is the signal, the key that unlocks the storehouse of food and energy.”

#### 2. Suitable Temperature  
Temperature acts like a thermostat for life.  
- **Too low** → embryo growth slows or stops.  
- **Too high** → delicate tissues are destroyed.  
- **Moderately warm (25°C–35°C)** → optimum for most seeds.  

Seeds of tropical plants often require warmer temperatures than those from temperate regions.  

*(Narrator’s tone, reflective)*  
“Each seed carries the memory of its homeland — tropical seeds wake in heat, temperate seeds prefer the gentler warmth of spring.”

#### 3. Oxygen  
As the embryo begins to grow, it needs energy. This comes from **respiration**, the burning of food. Oxygen is essential for this process. Without air, germination halts.  

Seeds sown **too deep in the soil** often fail to germinate because:  
1. Oxygen cannot reach them.  
2. The embryonic parts (hypocotyl or epicotyl) cannot push through the heavy layers of soil.  

*(Narrator’s close)*  
“Water swells it, warmth awakens it, oxygen feeds its energy. Together, these three form the holy trinity of germination.”
