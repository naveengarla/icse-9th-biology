## 6.4 Some Experiments on Germination  
*(Narrator’s voice, lively, like in a science show demonstration)*  

“Science does not only describe — it demonstrates. Let us now perform simple experiments that prove, one by one, the conditions needed for germination.”

### 1. Water is Necessary  
Take two beakers, A and B.  
- In A: place some green gram seeds on wet cotton wool.  
- In B: place similar seeds on dry cotton wool.  

Keep both in the same room.  

- Result: Seeds in beaker A germinate.  
- Seeds in B do not.  

*(Narrator’s aside)*  
“The message is simple: without water, the seed cannot swell, the coat cannot rupture, and the enzymes cannot act. Life waits, but does not begin.”

### 2. Suitable Temperature is Necessary  
Again, two beakers, A and B, with green gram seeds on wet cotton wool.  
- Beaker A: kept in an ordinary room.  
- Beaker B: kept in a refrigerator.  

- Result: Seeds in A germinate normally.  
- Seeds in B do not germinate quickly. At best, they sprout after several days, weakly.  

*(Narrator’s reflection)*  
“Temperature is the rhythm of life. Too cold, and growth slows to stillness. Moderately warm — 25°C to 35°C — and the embryo awakens. Seeds of the tropics demand even more heat than those of temperate lands.”

### 3. Oxygen is Necessary (Fig. 6.3)  
Take two conical flasks, A and B. Line them with wet cotton wool and place soaked gram seeds on it.  
- In flask B: suspend a small test-tube containing **alkaline pyrogallol solution** (which absorbs oxygen), without spilling a drop. Seal with a cork.  
- In flask A: suspend a similar test-tube, but filled with plain water.  

- Result:  
  - Seeds in flask A germinate — oxygen available.  
  - Seeds in flask B do not germinate — oxygen removed. At most, slight sprouting occurs due to anaerobic respiration.  

[Image/Diagram: Fig. 6.3 Seeds require air (oxygen) for germination.  
A — Seeds germinate in ordinary air,  
B — Seeds do not germinate without oxygen]  

*(Narrator’s tone, crisp)*  
“Oxygen is the invisible fuel. Without it, the embryo cannot release energy from food.”

### 4. The Three-Bean Experiment (Fig. 6.4)  
Take three mature, air-dried bean seeds. Tie them on a glass slide at three levels: top, middle, and bottom. Place the slide vertically in a beaker of water:  
- The **top seed** stays above water.  
- The **middle seed** stays just at water level.  
- The **bottom seed** is fully submerged.  

After a few days:  
- The middle seed germinates — it has both water and oxygen.  
- The top seed does not germinate — it has oxygen but no water.  
- The bottom seed fails after a tiny sprout — it has water but too little oxygen (dissolved oxygen is not enough).

*(Narrator’s close)*  
“Together, these experiments prove the lesson of nature: water to awaken, oxygen to energise, warmth to sustain. Germination is not magic. It is life responding faithfully to its three calls.”
